# recipe-recommender
This Recipe Recommender App helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have. The frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) collects user input and sends it to a Node.js Express backend, which securely fetches matching recipes from the Spoonacular API. The results are then displayed with images and titles for easy selection.
